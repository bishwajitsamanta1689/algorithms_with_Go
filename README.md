# Data Structures and Algorithms

**GO Data Structures and Algorithms**  
The intent of this repository is to solve with **Go Language** the problems identified by the **[Geeksforgeeks Algos to revision](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-algorithms-in-interview-questions/amp/)** article as a must known algorithms for coding interview. GO is a great language choice for technical interviews.  

WIP, the description of the below `unsolved yet` problems can be found in the orginal article.  

> ***Contributions are welcomed, following below guidelines***
> * keep the consistency and document the code
> * keep it simple, easy to read and understand (not over-engineered, best performance is not in scope)
