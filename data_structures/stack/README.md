# Stack

**[Stack Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type))**

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two main principal operations:

* push, which adds an element to the collection, and
* pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed.

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO (last in, first out).


## Implementation

### GO

* create a Struct with a slice
* push method to add to the stack
* pop method to remove an element from the Stack



### Python
